Rendering Grails Plugin
=======================

This plugin adds PDF, GIF, PNG and JPEG rendering facilities to Grails applications via the [XHTML Renderer](https://github.com/flyingsaucerproject/flyingsaucer) library.

Install
-------

To install just add to the dependency block in teh `build.gradle`

For Grail 7.x
```groovy
implementation 'io.github.gpc:rendering:7.0.0-RC1'
```

For Grails 3.x - 6.x
```groovy
implementation 'org.grails.plugins:rendering:2.0.3'
```

Usage
-----

Rendering is either done directly via one of the `«format»RenderingService` services …

    ByteArrayOutputStream bytes = pdfRenderingService.render(template: "/pdfs/report", model: [data: data])

Or via one of the `render«format»()` methods added to controllers …

    renderPdf(template: "/pdfs/report", model: [report: reportObject], filename: reportObject.name)
