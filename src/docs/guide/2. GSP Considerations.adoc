= GSP Considerations

There are a few things that you do need to be aware of when writing GSPs to be rendered via this plugin.

=== Link resources must be resolvable

All links to resources (e.g. images, css) must be _accessible by the application_. This is due to the linked resources being accessed by _application_ and not a browser. Depending on your network setup, ensure resources are available.

The rendering engine resolves all relative links relative to the `grails.serverURL` config property.

=== Must be well formed

The GSP must render to well formed, valid, XHTML. If it does not, a `grails.plugins.rendering.document.XmlParseException` will be thrown.

=== Must declare DOCTYPE

Without a doctype, you are likely to get parse failures due to unresolvable entity references (e.g. `&nbsp;`). Be sure to declare the XHTML doctype at the start of your GSP like so:

[source,xml]
----
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
 "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
