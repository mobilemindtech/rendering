= Rendering

There are four services available for rendering:

* `pdfRenderingService`
* `gifRenderingService`
* `pngRenderingService`
* `jpegRenderingService`

All services have the same method:

[source,java]
----
OutputStream render(Map args, OutputStream destination = new ByteArrayOutputStream())
----

The `args` define the render operation, with the bytes written to the given output stream. The given output stream is returned from the method. If no `destination` is provided, the render will write to a new `ByteArrayOutputStream`.

Here are some examples:

[source,java]
----
// Get the bytes
def bytes = gifRenderingService.render(template: '/images/coupon', model: [serial: 12345])

// Render to a file
new File("coupon.jpg").withOutputStream { outputStream ->
    jpegRenderingService.render([template: '/images/coupon', model: [serial: 12345]], outputStream)
}
----

For information on rendering to the HTTP response, see <<guide:5. Rendering To The Response,Rendering To The Response>>.

=== Basic Render Arguments

All rendering methods take a `Map` argument that specifies which template to render and the model to use (in most cases).

The following map arguments are common to all rendering methods:

* `template` (required) - The template to render
* `model` (optional) - The model to use
* `plugin` (optional) - The plug-in containing the template
* `controller` (optional) - The controller _instance_ or _name_ to resolve the template against (set automatically in provided `render«format»` methods on controllers).

=== Template Resolution

The plugin uses the same resolution strategy as the `render()` method in Grails controllers and taglibs.

That is,

* template files must start with an underscore (`_template.gsp`)
* template paths starting with `/` are resolved relative to the `views` directory
* template paths NOT starting with `/` are resolved relative to the `views/«controller»` directory

If the `template` argument does not start with a `/`, the `controller` argument must be provided. The methods added to controllers (e.g. `renderPdf()`) automatically pass the `controller` param for you.

=== Debugging

To get more visibility about what is going on inside, you can activate the logging within Flying Saucer by providing the system property `xr.util-logging.loggingEnabled` like so:

[source,shell]
----
grails -Dxr.util-logging.loggingEnabled=true run-app
----
